This is my first game on a web-browser, using Javascript, HTML and CSS!

My goal was to create a minesweeper game where you have to click on all the squares that do not contain a mine, as doing so would result in a failure. Clicking an empty square would give you a hint by displaying a number that would indicate how many mines are in its horizontal/vertical vicinity. Clicking on all available empty boxes on the board will result in a victory.

I used a multitude of tools and methods to do this project, including but no limited to: Javascript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, DOM, functions, and arrays.
